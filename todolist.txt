Things left to do:
	- create an object for Bezier curves for easier representation
		- differentiate (empirically?) a bezier curve
	
	- create an object for server side stuff like User, Classroom, etc.
	- build SQL PDO
	- create queries
	- implement AJAX and login flow
	- security

Explicitly set collation on database to be case insensitive where appropriate
Implement a merge sort etc. for showing the list of institutions according to:
	- prefix match
	- then alphabetical order

Use the ELSE IF feature more often in SQL
